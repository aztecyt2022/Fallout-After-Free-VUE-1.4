THIS ADDON IS FOR VUE EXPLOIT 1.4
do not use for any other version as it can mess with the ui
also 1.4 has fixed some issues that 1.3 and lower has...Please use 1.4 if you wanna use this theme.

Best to follow the text tut the best you can if you dont know what to do.


None of the exploit pages where changed or altered in anyway this is simply a U.I overhaul only..

I left all lapse and netctrl alone for best compatibility with all systems.
Do not change anything in the folder except main-menu.js, config_ui.js and payload_host.js
altering stuff outside of this can cause crashing and possibly system software reinstall issues.

You can add and remove images in the vue app so long as you rename it back to the way it was before you deleted it.

So if the img is called img003.png and you replaced it with a different image that has the name Icatpng.png then you must rename icatpng.png to img003.png or the image wont work.(You can go into the code and alter the name it calls for but aint notbody got time for that)

Please note that This version is stable as it can get. I do not take any resposibility if you alter it and break your system.
