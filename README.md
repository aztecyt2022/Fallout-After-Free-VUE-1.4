THIS ADDON IS FOR VUE EXPLOIT 1.4 and 1.5.

Downloading the .7zip file in the main repo works with 1.5.

using the release will work with 1.4(Untested for compatibility issues May work fine on both).

NOT FOR USE BELOW 1.4


A Helpful guide has been added to the .7zip file(Removed for now)
The video is not published at this time so it is not there.

Best to follow the text tut the best you can if you dont know what to do.


None of the exploit pages where changed or altered in anyway this is simply a U.I overhaul only..

(Removed from repo)
Do not change anything in the folder except main-menu.js, config_ui.js and payload_host.js
(Removed files that are not needed for the theme to function)

Please note that This version is stable as it can get. I do not take any resposibility if you alter it and break your system.



Please only use after you have finished the vue after free setup tut.
By moddedwarfare or anyone who is trusted to show the best install tut.
